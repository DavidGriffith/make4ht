make4ht
=======

Simple build system for tex4ht. Some day it may replace `t4ht` for generating `css` and `images`. First aim is to copy or move generated files to correct directories and possibility to write build scripts, allowing to run bibtex or indexing programs from make4ht run.

How it works
------------

Default compilation scripts for `tex4ht` compiles LaTeX files with this sequence:

    latex $latex_options 'code for loading tex4ht.sty \input{filename}'
    latex $latex_options 'code for loading tex4ht.sty \input{filename}'
    latex $latex_options 'code for loading tex4ht.sty \input{filename}'
    tex4ht options filename
    t4ht options filename

Problem is, if you need to run indexing program or bibtex, you need to create new script based on old one, or run htlatex twice, which means six LaTeX runs.

Other problem is with `t4ht` application. It reads file `filename.lg`, generated by `tex4ht`, where are instructions about generated files, css instructions, calls to external applications, instructions for image conversions etc. It can be instrued to copy generated files to some output directory, but it doesn't preserve directory structure, which means that if you have images in some subdirectory, they will be copied to output directory, but links will be pointing to non existing subdir.

Image conversion is directed with the [env file](http://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/mn35.html#index35-73001), with really strange syntax based on whitespace and [os dependent](http://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/mn-unix.html#index27-69005). Build scripts should be able to take image conversion process and also to enable actions like conversion with xslt processor ot tidy on output files, based on file extensions.



Idea is to use LUA file, with name `filename + .mk4 extension` where
